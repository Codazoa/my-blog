I've been working on this LED tetrahedron on and off for 4 years. After graduating
I finally had some time to sit down and focus on finishing what I started. The edges
are custom designed in Fusion360, and after more than a couple redesigns I was able
to get the peices to print on my Creality Ender3 Pro.

The biggest issue was getting the long pieces to fit on the small build plate of
the Ender3. Printing standing up would have worked but with each piece taking 7+ hours
to print and 5 of the first 6 prints failing I had to find a better way. The winning design
turned out to be a very simple redesign where each end cap was lengthened so the span peices
would fit just inside the printer's build volume with 5mm to spare on each end. After over 70
hours of printing I could start final assembly.

Since this project had to be able to run overnight off a battery, I decided to test it out.

It's a great feeling to see the final product taking shape. I had to check how the pieces would fit
together because it is one thing to see them fitting in the CAD software and it's another thing
entirely to try with physical objects because of the tolerances.

Here I had to learn how to apply the mirrored film without scratching it. The plexiglass didn't turn
out as good as I had hoped but for a first try they are acceptable.

Getting it all glued up. My original idea was to have this point be the base with all the wireing coming out of the bottom.

2nd section is holding strong. Each end piece joins with the middle span with a male/female connection. I then fill the female end of the end cap with liquid cement made for plastics as 
well as apply a generous helping of super glue to the flat edges.

After teaching myself how to solder, I got the LED strips cut, soldered, and attached to the base for a final test before all the panels go on.

(the project is done but I unfortunately did not get many pictures of it working before
it started falling apart from high heat in my tent at a music festival)
