I am a recent graduate in Computer Science with a strong desire to showcase my projects to a global audience. My passion lies in advocating for open source initiatives, underscoring my commitment to offering free and accessible projects for individuals to utilize and experiment with. In addition, I am deeply fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence and actively seek innovative ways to integrate its capabilities into my work. It is worth noting that I refrain from engaging on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, prioritizing privacy and the safeguarding of user data against the backdrop of significant technology conglomerates and advertising entities.
